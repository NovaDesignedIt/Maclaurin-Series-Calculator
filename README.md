## Purpose: 
You are employed by an architecture company to write code for a
building simulation. The company wants to model the start of the motion
response of a tall building hit by strong winds that set it in vibration that builds
up catastrophically. The following graph shows the vibration oscillations
growing catastrophically in time (along the x-axis) over a large number of
Oscillations:
